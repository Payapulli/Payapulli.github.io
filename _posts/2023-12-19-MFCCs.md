This project is a deep dive into advanced machine learning techniques using the Anuran Calls (MFCCs) Data Set. The focus is on multi-class and multi-label classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and exploring K-Means clustering for a multi-class, multi-label dataset.

## Part 1: Multi-Class and Multi-Label Classification Using SVMs
### Data Preparation and Setup
- **Data Download**: Fetching the Anuran Calls dataset and splitting it into a 70% training set.
- **Problem Understanding**: Each instance has three labels (Families, Genus, Species), presenting a multi-class and multi-label classification problem.

### Binary Relevance Approach
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Researching and applying exact match and hamming score/loss methods for evaluating the classifiers.
- **Gaussian Kernel SVMs**: Training a SVM for each label using Gaussian kernels and one-vs-all approach, optimizing SVM penalty and Gaussian kernel width via 10-fold cross-validation.

### L1-Penalized SVMs
- **Implementation and Standardization**: Implementing L1-penalized SVMs with standardized attributes, optimizing the SVM penalty using 10-fold cross-validation.

### Addressing Class Imbalance
- **Class Imbalance Remediation**: Applying SMOTE to address class imbalance and repeating the L1-penalized SVM training.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Reporting conclusions about the classifiers' performance.

### Additional Practices
- **Classifier Chain Method**: Studying and applying the Classifier Chain method to the classification problem.
- **Multi-Label Metrics Analysis**: Researching and computing confusion matrices, precision, recall, ROC, and AUC for the trained classifiers.

## Part 2: K-Means Clustering on a Multi-Class and Multi-Label Data Set
### Monte-Carlo Simulation
- **Clustering Execution**: Performing K-means clustering on the entire dataset 50 times, choosing k automatically via CH, Gap Statistics, scree plots, Silhouettes, or another method.
- **Majority Label Determination**: Identifying the majority family, genus, and species in each cluster by reading the true labels.

### Hamming Distance Analysis
- **Label Triplet Assignment**: Assigning a majority label triplet to each cluster.
- **Distance Calculation**: Computing the average Hamming distance, score, and loss between true labels and cluster-assigned labels, reporting the average and standard deviation of these metrics across 50 simulations.
