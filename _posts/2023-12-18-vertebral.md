This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Vertebral Column Data Set created by Dr. Henrique da Mota. The data set includes six biomechanical attributes from each patient, focusing on binary classification of Normal (NO) and Abnormal (AB) conditions...

## Dataset Overview
The dataset is explored through scatterplots and boxplots to understand the relationships and distributions of the variables. A subset of the data is selected as the training and test sets, adhering to specified criteria.

## KNN Classification
The project's core is implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with various metrics including Euclidean, Manhattan, and Chebyshev distances. Key points include:
- Optimizing `k` value based on error rates.
- Calculating metrics like confusion matrix, true positive and negative rates, precision, and F1-score.
- Analyzing learning curves against different training set sizes.

## Advanced Techniques
Further exploration includes:
- Testing different distance metrics and summarizing their performance.
- Implementing weighted voting for improved decision making.
- Evaluating nonlinear associations and interaction terms in regression models.

## Conclusions and Findings
The project concludes with insights into the best performing models, optimal `k` values, and the lowest training error rate achieved.
