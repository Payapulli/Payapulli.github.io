to distinguish between normal and abnormal conditions. It involves exploratory data analysis with visualizations like scatterplots and boxplots to understand the data's distribution. A key part of the project is the application of KNN (k-nearest neighbors) classification to predict conditions, optimizing the 'k' value through testing error rates and computing performance metrics like precision and F1-score. The study also explores the effects of training set size on model accuracy, introducing a learning curve and experimenting with different distance metrics to refine predictions.
