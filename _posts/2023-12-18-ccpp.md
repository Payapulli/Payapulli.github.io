This project delves into a detailed dataset from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over six years (2006-2011), where the main goal is to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP). The dataset features include hourly average ambient variables: Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), and Exhaust Vacuum (V)...

## Project Overview
The project begins with downloading and exploring the dataset, examining the number of rows and columns, and understanding what they represent. This step includes making scatterplots of all variables and observing the relationships between independent and dependent variables.

## Data Analysis and Insights
Statistical analysis is conducted to find the mean, median, range, quartiles, and interquartile ranges of each variable. This is summarized in a comprehensive table for an easy overview of the data characteristics.

## Regression Models
The core of the project involves:
- Developing simple linear regression models for each predictor and assessing their significance in predicting the plant's output.
- Constructing a multiple regression model using all predictors and identifying the most impactful ones.
- A comparative study between univariate and multiple regression models is presented visually.

## Advanced Analysis
The exploration extends to:
- Examining nonlinear associations between predictors and response using polynomial regression models.
- Investigating interactions between different predictors and their impact on the response.
- A thorough analysis of these models is presented, including the training and testing Mean Squared Errors (MSEs).

## KNN Regression
The project also includes KNN regression analysis, comparing both normalized and raw features to determine the best fit. The analysis of train and test errors provides valuable insights into the model's performance.

## Comparative Study and Conclusions
The project concludes with a comparison between KNN Regression and the most effective linear regression model. This comparative analysis provides a deep understanding of different modeling approaches in predicting energy output in power plants.
