In this project, I explore the intricate task of classifying human activities based on time series data from the AReM dataset. This dataset, derived from a Wireless Sensor Network, includes detailed recordings of seven different types of human activities. Each activity is captured through six time series, presenting a rich dataset for analysis. The project is divided into two main parts: Feature Creation/Extraction and Binary/Multiclass Classification.

### Data Preparation and Segmentation
- **Dataset Download**: Acquiring the AReM dataset from its official source.
- **Training and Test Split**: Strategically dividing the dataset into training and test sets based on predefined criteria.

### Feature Extraction
- **Time-Domain Feature Research**: Identifying various time-domain features commonly used in time series classification.
- **Feature Extraction Process**: Extracting key features like minimum, maximum, mean, median, standard deviation, first quartile, and third quartile from each time series.
- **Normalization/Standardization**: Considering the option to normalize or standardize these features.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Estimating the standard deviation of each feature and constructing a 90% bootstrap confidence interval.
- **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most significant time-domain features based on analysis.

### Binary Classification Using Logistic Regression
- **Feature-based Visualization**: Creating scatter plots of the selected features to distinguish between bending and other activities.
- **Time Series Segmentation for Analysis**: Breaking each time series into two or more segments and examining the impact on feature representation.
- **Logistic Regression Modeling**: Implementing logistic regression with various segmentations and feature sets, including p-value analysis for model parameters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model through confusion matrices, ROC curves, AUC, and logistic regression parameter significance.

### Binary Classification Using L1-penalized Logistic Regression
- **Implementation of L1-penalized Logistic Regression**: Utilizing L1 regularization in logistic regression and comparing it with variable selection using p-values.
- **Model Comparison and Analysis**: Evaluating the effectiveness and ease of implementation between L1-penalized and standard logistic regression.

### Multiclass Classification
- **L1-penalized Multinomial Regression**: Implementing and testing an L1-penalized multinomial regression model for classifying all activities.
- **Naïve Bayes Classification**: Comparing Gaussian and Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifiers for multiclass classification.
