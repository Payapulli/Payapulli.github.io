In this project, I explore the intricate task of classifying human activities based on time series data from the AReM dataset. This dataset, derived from a Wireless Sensor Network, includes detailed recordings of seven different types of human activities. Each activity is captured through six time series, presenting a rich dataset for analysis. The project is divided into two main parts: Feature Creation/Extraction and Binary/Multiclass Classification.

### Data Preparation and Segmentation
- **Dataset Download**: Acquiring the AReM dataset from its official source.
- **Training and Test Split**: Strategically dividing the dataset into training and test sets based on predefined criteria.

### Feature Extraction
- **Time-Domain Feature Research**: Identifying various time-domain features commonly used in time series classification.
- **Feature Extraction Process**: Extracting key features like minimum, maximum, mean, median, standard deviation, first quartile, and third quartile from each time series.
- **Normalization/Standardization**: Considering the option to normalize or standardize these features.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Estimating the standard deviation of each feature and constructing a 90% bootstrap confidence interval.
- **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most significant time-domain features based on analysis.

### Binary Classification Using Logistic Regression
- **Feature-based Visualization**: Creating scatter plots of the selected features to distinguish between bending and other activities.
- **Time Series Segmentation for Analysis**: Breaking each time series into two or more segments and examining the impact on feature representation.
- **Logistic Regression Modeling**: Implementing logistic regression with various segmentations and feature sets, including p-value analysis for model parameters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model through confusion matrices, ROC curves, AUC, and logistic regression parameter significance.

### Binary Classification Using L1-penalized Logistic Regression
- **Implementation of L1-penalized Logistic Regression**: Utilizing L1 regularization in logistic regression and comparing it with variable selection using p-values.
- **Model Comparison and Analysis**: Evaluating the effectiveness and ease of implementation between L1-penalized and standard logistic regression.

## Results

The L1 regularized model performs the best.

It has the highest testing accuracy of the three, and the training accuracy is 1.0 across the board for all three as well. On top of this model is easier to implement than using variable selection with p values as it performs feature selection automatically, and runs the fastest out of the three.

### Multiclass Classification
- **L1-penalized Multinomial Regression**: Implementing and testing an L1-penalized multinomial regression model for classifying all activities.
- **Naïve Bayes Classification**: Comparing Gaussian and Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifiers for multiclass classification.

## Results

The best performers are the L1 regularized and the Naive Bayes classifier with Gaussian priors, with two missclassifications as opposed to three from the Naive Bayes classifier with Multinomial priors.

Based on the ROC curves on the testing data, the L1 penalized multinomial regression model performs the best for multi-class classification. This method also has the advantage of performing feature selection as part of the training process which helps in creating a less complex model that is less prone to overfitting.
