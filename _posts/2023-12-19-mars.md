In this project, I tackle the challenge of identifying frost in Martian terrain images using advanced machine learning techniques. The task involves analyzing a unique dataset of Martian terrain images, implementing and comparing various models including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning with pre-trained networks.

## Data Exploration and Pre-processing
### Dataset Overview
- **Data Retrieval**: Downloading the Anuran Calls dataset, which consists of 214 subframes and a total of 119920 tiles, each labeled as ‘frost’ or ‘background.’

### Data Organization and Preparation
- **Data Splitting**: Utilizing provided files to divide the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets.
- **Image Processing**: Implementing image augmentation techniques like cropping, zooming, rotating, and translating to enhance the dataset's diversity.

## Training CNN + MLP
### Model Architecture and Training
- **CNN Implementation**: Building a three-layer CNN followed by a dense layer. Incorporating ReLU activations, softmax function, batch normalization, dropout (30%), L2 regularization, and ADAM optimizer.
- **Training Process**: Training the model for at least 20 epochs with early stopping based on validation set performance. Plotting training and validation errors vs. epochs.

### Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Reporting Precision, Recall, and F1 score for the CNN + MLP model.

## Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models
### Implementing Transfer Learning
- **Pre-trained Models**: Using EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and VGG16 as feature extractors. Training only the last fully connected layer while freezing earlier layers.
- **Model Training**: Repeating image augmentation processes and training each model for at least 10 (preferably 20) epochs. Implementing early stopping and plotting errors vs. epochs.

### Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Reporting Precision, Recall, and F1 score for each transfer learning model.

### Comparative Analysis
- **Model Comparison**: Comparing the results of the transfer learning models with the CNN + MLP model and providing explanations for observed performances.
