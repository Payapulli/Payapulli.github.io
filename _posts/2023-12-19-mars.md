In this project, I tackle the challenge of identifying frost in Martian terrain images using advanced machine learning techniques. The task involves analyzing a unique dataset of Martian terrain images, implementing and comparing a Convolutional Neural Network + Multi-Layer Perceptron trained from scratch vs Transfer Learning with pre-trained networks (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and VGG16).

## Data Exploration and Pre-processing
### Dataset Overview
- **Data Retrieval**: Downloading the Martian HiRISE Images dataset, which consists of 214 subframes and a total of 119920 tiles, each labeled as ‘frost’ or ‘background.’

### Data Organization and Preparation
- **Data Splitting**: Utilizing provided files to divide the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets.
- **Image Processing**: Implementing an image augmentation pipeline to crop, zoom, rotate, and translate the images to make our model more robust to different orientations/scaling.

## Training CNN + MLP
### Model Architecture and Training
- **CNN Implementation**: Building a three-layer CNN followed by a dense layer. Incorporating ReLU activations, softmax function, batch normalization, dropout (30%), L2 regularization, and ADAM optimizer.
- **Training Process**: Training the model for 20 epochs with early stopping based on validation set performance. Plotting training and validation errors vs. epochs.

### Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Reporting Precision, Recall, and F1 score for the CNN + MLP model.

## Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models
### Implementing Transfer Learning
- **Pre-trained Models**: Using EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and VGG16 as feature extractors. Training only the last fully connected layer and freezing the previous layers.
- **Model Training**: Repeating image augmentation processes and training each model for 10 epochs. Implementing early stopping and plotting errors vs. epochs.

### Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Reporting Precision, Recall, and F1 score for each transfer learning model.

### Conclusion
It is immediately apparent that this dataset is very challenging to learn from even for Pre-trained models such as ResNet50 that usually perform very well on image classification problems.

The CNN + MLP model did not really seem to learn from the data as it has a training accuracy 0.57 and a test accuracy of 0.49. The Transfer Learning models (specifically the ResNet and VGG models) however are able to learn from the data but are likely overfitting. ResNet has a training accuracy of 0.78 and VGG has a training accuracy of 0.92, with a test accuracy of 0.55, 0.53 respectively.

As such, we can say that the Transfer learning models (specifically ResNet and VGG) outperform the CNN + MLP model as they are at least able to learn from the data, despite definitely being overfit, they also have a slightly higher test accuracy. This makes sense as our test data (images of Mars) is probably very different to the data that these Transfer Learning models learned on, so these models are probably learning some pattern from these data that does not generalize well to new unseen data of this type (Martian terrain).
