        <h3>Vertebral Column Data Set Analysis</h3>
        <p> This Biomedical data set was built by Dr. Henrique da Mota during a medical residence
            period in Lyon, France. Each patient in the data set is represented in the data set
            by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis
            and lumbar spine. You can find this dataset at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Vertebral+Column/</p>
        <p> A significant part of the project was dedicated to classification using KNN, where various 
            metrics like Euclidean, Minkowski, Manhattan, and Chebyshev distances were explored. 
            I also implemented weighted decision-making in KNN and analyzed different training sizes to observe the learning curve.</p>
        <p>Key techniques: Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, KNN Classification, Distance Metrics Analysis.</p>
